    <string name="article_text">In a vault deep inside Abbey Road Studios in London — protected by
        an unmarked, triple-locked, police-alarmed door — are something like 400 hours of unreleased
        Beatles recordings, starting from June 2, 1962 and ending with the very last tracks recorded
        for the Let It Be album. The best of the best were released by Apple Records in the form of
        the 3-volume Anthology series. For more information, see the Beatles Time Capsule at
        www.rockument.com. \n\n This volume starts with the first new Beatle song,
        “Free as a Bird” (based on a John Lennon demo, found only on The Lost Lennon Tapes
        Vol. 28, and covers the very earliest historical recordings, outtakes from the first albums,
        and live recordings from early concerts and BBC Radio sessions. </string>
